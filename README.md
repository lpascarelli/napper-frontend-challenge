# Napper frontend challenge

Welcome to the take home challenge for Senior Frontend Engineer at Napper üéâ

- Should take approximately 2 hours to complete
- You can complete it at any time within a week of receiving your invitation


Your task is to build an editable and animating (using reanimated) grid for selecting log categories to track. Very similar to the tracking grid we have in our current app, but with fewer bells and whistles. 

## Setup
This repository contains boilerplate code in React Native (TypeScript) with Expo to help you get started. It is set up to work with `yarn` and has all the libraries you need added as dependencies. 

Get started by installing the dependencies using `yarn` and starting expo. Simplest way to develop with Expo is to download the [Expo go](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/expo-go/) app on your device and use `yarn expo start` while on the same network. You can then scan the QR code in your terminal with your device. You could also use a local simulator using `yarn ios` on mac (requires xcode) or `yarn android` (requires android studio). 

If you encounter any issues in the setup, please consult the [Expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) or reach out to us at Napper. 

## Task details
You should have received a link to a Figma that will be your guide and source of truth for this challenge. Try to follow it as closely as you can. We encourage you to make appropriate assumptions when needed to develop something you are happy with. 

You will create a simplified version of the tracking drawer in the Napper app. The grid will display available categories (you can make these up). There should be a button to edit the grid. Editing the grid means changing which categories are visible. 

We want you to use [React Native Reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) (added as a dependency) to add transitions and animations to the cards when editing the grid. 

When you feel happy with your work. Open up a PR against the main branch and request a review from us üëè

## Clarifications
- The grid should not be drag and drop, no gestures are needed
- Clicking the cards doesn‚Äôt do anything
- You can make up any category strings
- Please use the assets available in the Figma


## We we look for
- An intuition for creating snappy frontends and user experiences  
- Proficiency in writing well-structured easy to read code
- Fundamental understanding TypeScript and React
- Attention to detail
- Ability to follow Figma designs
- Ability to read documentation, learn fast and solve new problems
